##to start the task2, I started by revising the basic concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Python programming from my college notes. I wanted to ensure I had a good understanding of how text data can be analyzed and how machine learning models can classify sentiment. To further deepen my knowledge, I took referance from online platforms like youtube and used ChatGPT to help explain sentiment analysis in simple words. These platforms helped me understand that sentiment analysis is the process of identifying whether a piece of text expresses a positive or negative opinion. Once I understood the theory, I decided to apply it using a custom dataset of 100 customer reviews, with an equal number of positive and negative sentiments. I prepared this dataset in Excel and uploaded it to Google Colab, which allowed me to easily write and execute Python code in the cloud. I began by importing necessary Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, sklearn’s TfidfVectorizer, LogisticRegression, and model evaluation tools. I then read the dataset using pandas.read_excel() and mapped the sentiment labels ("positive" and "negative") into binary values (1 and 0) using a dictionary, just like I had done in my first task. To prepare the text data for machine learning, I used the TF-IDF vectorizer, which converted each review into a numeric format based on word frequency. I then split the data into training and testing sets, trained a Logistic Regression model, and evaluated its performance using accuracy and classification report. Finally, I tested the model with new sample reviews to see if it could correctly predict the sentiment. The model responded with either “Positive” or “Negative” based on the text input. This small project helped me understand how powerful NLP is in analyzing human opinions. In real-life applications, sentiment analysis is widely used in: Customer Feedback Analysis – understanding if reviews are good or bad, Product Improvement – using user feedback to make changes, Brand Monitoring – tracking brand reputation on social media, Market Research – analyzing public opinion about products or policies, and Chatbots – detecting user emotions to give better responses.
